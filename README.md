# Autodocking
This is a project for my EG2605 UROP.
It is a stimulation for Gazebo to allow mobile robot to dock with charging station using visual input to detect AR tag and using PI-control to adjust wheel velocity.

You may watch the Gazebo stimulation results here: [youtubelink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvYQjFvl8ig&ab_channel=KboonHo)
